# physmem_alloc_analysis: Physical memory allocation analysis

This directory contains code to profile physical memory allocation
for mmap, and analyze how contiguous the assigned physical frames are.

## How to run the program:

To compile and run the profiler:

```
./make.sh
./physmem_alloc_profiler [-a alloc_size] [-s sleep_sec]
```

The profiler mmaps a chunk of memory of `alloc_size` (pages) each time,
computes the assigned physical frames using `/proc/pid/pagemap` interface,
and munmaps it. It then sleeps `sleep_sec` (seconds) before the next iteration. 
The program loops infinitely so manual Control-C is needed to stop it. 
A file named `physmem_alloc_results` is generated to record the assigned 
physical frame numbers.

To analyze the results, run:

```
./analyze.sh
```

This takes `physmem_alloc_results` as input and produces another file: 
`contiguous_results`. As output, it shows the content of `contiguous_results`
and invokes gnuplot for plotting as well.

## Output format

For `physmem_alloc_results`, each line contains information for each mmap
allocation. The assigned physical frame numbers of each page are separated 
by space.

For `contiguous_results` (which is also shown as output for analyze.sh),
each line is of the following format:

```
size    count   size_total    fraction
```

where:

* `size` is the size (in number of pages) of virtual memory area that 
  assigned with contiguous physical frames.

* `count` is the number of times such virtual memory area appears.

* `size_total` = `size` * `count`, i.e., it is the total size 
  (in number of pages) for such memory area.

* `fraction` = `size_total` / `alloc_total`, where `alloc_total` is
  the sum of `size_total` of all rows. Therefore, `fraction` means
  out of all virtual pages, what fraction of them are inside an area
  of `size` pages whose underlying physical memory frames are contiguous.
